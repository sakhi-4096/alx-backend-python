# Unittests and Integration Tests
Unit tests are a type of testing where individual components or functions of a program are tested in isolation. Integration tests involve testing the interaction between different components or systems to ensure that they work together as expected.

## Description
Integration tests involve testing the interaction between different components or systems to ensure that they work together as expected. The goal is to identify issues that may arise when integrating multiple units or systems. Unit tests are a type of testing where individual components or functions of a program are tested in isolation. The goal is to verify that each part of the software performs as designed. Unit tests are typically written by developers and focus on small units of code, such as functions or methods.

> In a well-rounded testing strategy, both unit tests and integration tests are essential. Unit tests catch issues at the individual component level, while integration tests catch issues that arise when these components interact. Together, they contribute to building robust and reliable software.

## Comparison
* **Scope:** Unit tests focus on individual units of code in isolation, while integration tests focus on how different units or systems work together.
* **Speed:** Unit tests are generally faster to execute because they focus on small units of code. Integration tests may take longer due to the broader scope and involvement of multiple components.
* **Purpose:** Unit tests help ensure that each part of the software works as intended. Integration tests help ensure that different components or systems can collaborate successfully.
* **Dependency:** Unit tests should be independent, and their results should not be affected by other tests. Integration tests depend on the successful integration of various components.
