## Description
It is responsible for handling requests from the client, processing data, and managing the interaction with the database. Python is a popular programming language that is commonly used for backend development.

In a typical web application architecture, the frontend (client-side) is responsible for the user interface and interaction, while the backend (server-side) handles the business logic, database interactions, and other server-related tasks.

Python is often used with web frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI for backend development. These frameworks provide a structure and set of tools for building web applications efficiently. Django, for example, includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions, a templating engine for rendering HTML, and a routing system for handling different URL paths.

In summary, when people refer to "backend Python," they are usually talking about using Python for server-side development in web applications, often with the help of web frameworks.
